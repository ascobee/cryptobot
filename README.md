# Cryptobot

Cryptobot is a Python project that I'm currently obsessed with. This user-friendly interface allows you to research, monitor, and trade cryptocurrencies through your Robinhood account. I'm adding new features and functionality from a growing list of ideas weekly. Some of the existing features include: execute new market/limit orders, view or cancel existing orders, and produce graphs of historical data. I'm currently working on the next prominent feature: market predictions using machine learning.

## Usage

Use `python -m cryptobot.cli` to start the main menu.
